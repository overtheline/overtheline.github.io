      Hello, I am Aaron. I grew up in a small town in northern California. It was very hot there in the summers. My friends and I would skateboard in that heat almost everyday in high school. I did not enjoy the heat when I lived there, and everytime I visit it seems to have gotten hotter. In the summer, everything that was green in the spring would turn to a dry golden color. Fields and hills would dry up into a yellow blanket. There are many cow pastures in northern California. On the hot days you would see the cows crowd together in the shade of a billboard placed next to a highway.

      Now I live in Seattle. The temperature is cooler and there are less cows. I don't ride a skateboard as much anymore, but I have many other things to do now. The path from the hot summers in northern California to Seattle has been a winding path. I have been to college, had a few jobs, and I am always looking forward to the next adventure.
